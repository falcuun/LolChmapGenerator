## League Of Legends - Random Champion Generator

After surfing my GitHub I decided to revisit this, my first ever, project.

This project has been updated to follow some of the more modern coding practices, but also, it was modified in a way where nothing is hardcoded anymore. 
The Application is now using JSON files for data storage (There is no need for any database given that it's not dynamic nor is it updating so often that it would need one) and unlike old one, it's way more scalable and flexible with features. 

There UI of the application differs mostly due to the fact that it was built using IntelliJ's form builder, where as the old one was using NetBeans (8.something) designer which, in my opinion, was far superior in comparisson. I did not want to dwell too much on the UI, but was more interested in the back-end logic which needed heavy retouching. 

Interestingly enough, all of the old back-end logic is now gone and has been replaced. Which goes to show how bad the old one was.
