This was the first ever JAVA Project that I've done that wasn't as school (university) project. It was done when I had no understanding of GUI and while I had no idea what JSON or XML was. This code will be kept in this branch to display the difference 4 years of experience can do.

Even though I haven't done that much JAVA in past 4 years, I was able to reduce the amount of code by a lot, after years of programming, I have learned of different data structures and of different ways to work with data, likewise, the technologies (Frameworks, libraries etc... ) have advanced, allowing me to easier perform some of the tasks even though I'm unfamiliar with the language. 

I intend to keep this code in this branch in order to remind myself of my humble beginnings, and to remind myself how even then, when introduced to a challenge, I still found a way to solve it, even if it wasn't the most optmized or the best coded way.
Also, I think this is a great pointer for those who doubt themselves that they could become better programmers just by spending more time programming, it is very easy to see that with experience and with time, there is significant difference in how we approach certain problems. 

This code also displays how I improved myself compared to a 4 years younger, beginner, me. And it's a great way to boost my own self confidence and trust that I am a better programmer now than I was long ago. 

Back when this code was originally written, it took over few weeks, maybe 2 months. Today, it took only few hours and most of that time was spent figuring out the library quirkcs. And I am certain that if I attempt it again in few years, it will be even faster and even better.

Hope this helps anyone who stumbles upon this project.

Keep on coding!
